        <h2>GENERAL</h2>
        <h4>What is the Oracle Autonomous Database?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Oracle Autonomous Database is the world’s first autonomous data management in the cloud to deliver automated patching, upgrades, and tuning—including performing all routine database maintenance tasks while the system is running - without human intervention. This new autonomous database cloud is self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing, which helps to eliminate manual database management and human errors.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">The Oracle Autonomous Database is fully elastic: You simply specify the number of OCPUs and the storage capacity in TB's for the database. At any time, you may scale up or down the OCPUs or the storage capacity.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet"><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/autonomous-add-resources.html#GUID-DA72422A-5A70-42FA-A363-AB269600D4B0" target="_blank">Click here for more information.</a>
        </p>
        <h4>What is the difference between a Dedicated Infrastructure vs. Shared Infrastructure deployment?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Dedicated deployment is a deployment choice that enables you to provision autonomous databases into their own dedicated Exadata cloud infrastructure, instead of a shared infrastructure with other tenants. Autonomous Database on Dedicated Infrastructure is also available in customer's data centers with Exadata Cloud at Customer.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">With Shared Infrastructure deployment, which is the simplest configuration, you share the resources of an Exadata cloud infrastructure. You can quickly get started with no minimum commitment, enjoying quick database provisioning and independent scalability of compute and storage.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">All deployment options (Shared, Dedicated in Oracle Cloud and Dedicated Cloud@Customer) are available with Autonomous Transaction Processing and Autonomous Data Warehouse. Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse provides a fully-managed database that is tuned and optimized for data warehouse workloads. Autonomous Transaction Processing enables businesses to safely run a complex mix of high-performance transactions, reporting, batch, and machine learning along with simpler and faster application development.
        </p>
        <h4>How do I connect to the Oracle Autonomous Database?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">ADB is built upon the Oracle Database, therefore, applications and tools that support Oracle Database also support ADB. These tools and applications connect to the service using standard database connectivity such as SQL*Net or JDBC. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/atp-cloud/atpug/connect-data-warehouse.html#GUID-94719269-9218-4FAF-870E-6F0783E209FD" target="_blank">Click here for more information.</a>

        </p>
        <h4>Does the backup process continue to run even if you shut down the database, for example to reduce costs?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">A full back up will still happen. However, once the service has been stopped there is no need to do incremental backups because the database is not active.
        </p>
        <h4>What is the process to restore an Oracle Autonomous Database instance?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">The restore process is very simple - select a specific point in time to restore via the management console.
        </p>
        <h4>Can a customer restore an Oracle Autonomous Database backup into another Database Cloud deployment?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">No, you cannot restore an ADB backup into another cloud service. You can export an ADB database to an object store and then import into another service.
        </p>
        <h4>Can a customer use an Oracle Autonomous Database backup to restore a database to another/new Oracle Autonomous Database instance?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">No, ADB backups can only be used to restore and recover to the same database. However, customers have the ability to clone a database and can choose to clone either the full database or only the database metadata.
        </p>
        <h4>Can a clone be refreshed when new data is available?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes. A refreshable clone can be easily updated with changes from the source database. A refreshable clone allows the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="cta-list" style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1em; margin-left:175px;">
            <li>- Maintain one or more copies of the source database for use as read-only databases. A clone database is available when needed, and when the data needs to be updated, simply refresh the clone from its source database.
            </li>
            <li>- Share copies of a production database with multiple business units. For example, one business unit might use the source database for ongoing transactions and another business unit could at the same time use the refreshable clone database for read-only operations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        &nbsp;
        <h4>Oracle Autonomous Database provides a manual backup option on the cloud console that takes a backup to the object store. What can I use this back up for? Can I restore it to my own database server?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">No, the manual backup, which you must move to your object store bucket, can only be used by ADB. You can use the manual backup functionality for cases like backing up before a large data load.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">Note, if you initiate a restore operation ADB may decide to use your object store backup rather than one of its automatic backups – if it will be faster to restore.
        </p>
        <h4>What happens if you cannot access Oracle Autonomous Database, i.e. the whole service is down?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Oracle is responsible for the service availability. Therefore, if the whole service goes down it’s Oracles responsibility to get the service back online ASAP.
        </p>
        <h4>Is it possible to clone production databases for development/test/QA environments?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes, ADB provides the ability to clone a database and you can choose to clone either the full database or only the database metadata.
        </p>
        <h4>Can the dev/test/QA cloned instances be masked?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes it is possible to use Oracle Data Safe data masking capabilities with cloned instances of ADB. For more information <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/security/data-safe.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.

        <p class="bullet">Application servers should be provisioned in the same Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Region.</p>
        <div><a name="LOADING-BOOKMARK"></a></div>
        <h2>LOADING DATA</h2>
        <h4>Is Oracle Data Integration via Oracle Cloud Marketplace supported with Oracle Autonomous Database?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes, Oracle data integration tools are configured to work with ADB.</p>
        <h4>What are the options for loading data into Oracle Autonomous Database?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">There are multiple ways to load data into ADB:</p>
        <p class="nobullet">ADB is integrated with multiple object storage services for data loading. You can upload your source files to one of these object-stores and use the PL/SQL API DBMS_CLOUD to load data into your database. ADB supports Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Classic, AWS S3, and Azure Blob Storage for loading data. This is the recommended method for loading large data sets. SQL Developer also provides a data loading wizard that can load data from these object stores.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">You can use Data Pump Import to load data from dump files. Data Pump Import is integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Classic, AWS S3, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. You can upload your dump files to one of these object-stores and import from those dump files.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">You can also use client-side tools like SQL*Loader, or your in-house scripts to load data from files residing on your client machines.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">Another option is to use Oracle tools and cloud services like GoldenGate, ODI, GoldenGate Cloud Service, and Oracle BI Data Sync.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">Any 3rd party ETL tool that can connect to ADB using the security credentials wallet can also be used to load data.
        </p>
        <h4>Do customers need to upload data files to the Oracle Object Store for data loading?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">For large data sets, uploading the source files to Oracle Object Storage and loading from the Object Store will most likely be faster than other options.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">But you can use the other data loading options too depending on your use-case and requirements. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/atp-cloud/atpug/load-data.html#GUID-07900054-CB65-490A-AF3C-39EF45505802">Click here for more information</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Is GoldenGate on-premises and GoldenGate Cloud Service supported with ADB?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes, GoldenGate supports ADB as both a target and source system.</p>
        <p class="nobullet">Please see the GoldenGate <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/goldengate/core/19.1/oracle-db/using-ogg-autonomous-databases.html#GUID-660E754E-B9A6-48DD-AA66-0D6B66A022CD">documentation</a> for more information about configuring GoldenGate with ADB.
        </p>
        <h4>Do I need to gather optimizer statistics after data loading?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">ADB gathers optimizer statistics automatically if you are using the PL/SQL API DBMS_CLOUD, or if the tools and scripts you use to load data are using direct path loads. If you are using conventional DML operations to load data, then you will need to gather optimizer statistics yourself or let the nightly statistics gathering job gather statistics for objects that have stale statistics.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">See the FAQ for both Autonomous Data Warehouse and Autonomous Transaction Processing for more details.
        </p>
        <h4>Does the data loading process support Avro files?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes. Autonomous Database can now read Avro files and parse the schema within the file to create the columns with the appropriate Oracle Database data types. Avro files may include complex types – like arrays, structs, maps and more; ADW supports avro files that contain Oracle data types. <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/oracle-autonomous-databases-accessing-apache-avro-files">Click here for more information</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Does the data loading process support Parquet files?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes. Autonomous Database can now read Parquet files and parse the schema within the file to create the columns with the appropriate Oracle Database data types. <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/oracle-autonomous-data-warehouse-access-parquet-files-in-object-stores">Click here for more information</a>.

        </p>
        <h4>Does the data loading process support pre-authenticated URLs?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes. If source files reside on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage it is possible to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure pre-authenticated URIs. When a pre-authenticated request is created, a unique URL is generated. This unique URL can then be provided to users, partners, or third parties to access the Object Storage resource target identified in the pre-authenticated request.
        </p>
        <h4>Can I connect ADB to data stored on Hadoop?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes. Autonomous Database can now query data in Big Data Service's Hadoop clusters. Big Data Service includes the Cloud SQL Query Server - which is an Oracle-based SQL on Hadoop query execution engine.

        <div><a name="SCHEMA-BOOKMARK"></a></div>
        <h2>SCHEMA DESIGN AND QUERYING</h2>
        <h4>Which data models does ADB support? Is there a recommended data modelling technique for ADB?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">ADB supports all the usual schema models such star schema, snowflake and 3NF. The same basic design concepts still apply when designing data warehouse/data mart schemas and schemas to support OLTP applications. The main difference between ADB and a non-autonomous Oracle Database is that you do not need to specify the physical properties of tables (e.g., partitioning, indexes, compression, storage details etc).
        </p>
        <h4>Does ADB come with any predefined data models?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">There are no predefined data models in the ADB. You create your own schema, tables and other database objects as needed.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">You can use SQL Data Modeler to design a new logical model and physical model, then generate the required DDL script(s) to implement your model in ADB. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/manage-service.html#GUID-69906542-4DF6-4759-ABC1-1817D77BDB02">Click here for more information.</a>
        </p>
        <h4>What is the algorithm for the automatic tuning?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">The precise details of how autonomous capabilities are implemented inside ADB are considered proprietary and internal.
        </p>
        <h4>Can a customer create primary and foreign key constraints on tables in Oracle Autonomous Database?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes, you can create any constraint just like you do in a regular Oracle Database.</p>
        <h4>Can a customer create secondary indexes, partitioned tables, or materialized views?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes, you can create secondary indexes, partitioned tables, or materialized views in ADB.</p>
        <p class="nobullet">For specific guidance on when this should be done, please see the specific FAQ sections for Autonomous Data Warehousing and Autonomous Transaction Processing.
        </p>
        <h4>Does ADB automatically create indexes?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes, where the database version is 19c which is required for Auto-Indexing. Note that auto-indexing is not on by default.
        </p>
        <h4>Does ADB have full PL/SQL support?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes, customers can utilize nearly all the PL/SQL capabilities. The small set of limitations is listed in the appendices of the ATP and ADW documentation.
        </p>
        <div><a name="MANAGING-BOOKMARK"></a></div>
        <h2>MANAGING AND MONITORING</h2>
        <h4>Is there an option to delay or reschedule patches?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">For Shared Infrastructure deployments - No. Oracle patches ADB in maintenance windows. Currently, users cannot change the patching schedule. The date-time for the next scheduled maintenance is shown on the OCI console page for each instance.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">With Dedicated Infrastructure deployments, you have the option to change the maintenance windows to control when the Exadata environments and the databases are updated.
        </p>
        <h4>If a quarterly patch has an adverse effect, who will notice (does Oracle monitor)? Will rollback be offered?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">You cannot rollback patches yourself. Only Oracle operations can rollback a patch. Oracle operations will monitor patching and rollback if a patch cannot be applied successfully according to basic sanity tests. However, there is always a chance that the adverse effect is only observable from the application. In that case, you will have to notify Oracle via a Service Request(SR).
        </p>
        <h4>Does Oracle Autonomous Database have auto-scaling?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes, ADB does have auto-scaling and this enabled by default when you create a new instance. You can select auto scaling during provisioning or later using the Scale Up/Down button on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/start-stop-grow.html#GUID-DA72422A-5A70-42FA-A363-AB269600D4B0">Click here for more information</a>
        </p>
        <h4>Can I access the database server's operating system?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">No. ADB does not allow access to the operating system.</p>
        <h4>How can I monitor database performance in Oracle Autonomous Database?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">ADB provides the following monitoring consoles:</p>
        <div style=" margin-left:55px;">
            <p class="nobullet"><strong>Oracle Management Cloud</strong> - supports monitoring Autonomous Databases via its Oracle Database Management console. This provides both monitoring and alerting for your Autonomous Database instances. The Performance Hub page provides both high-level and detailed performance metrics for your Autonomous Database instances. Use of Oracle Management Cloud is included as part of your Autonomous Data Warehouse and Autonomous Transaction Processing services. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/management-cloud/mcdbm/introduction-oracle-database-management.html">Click here for more information</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="nobullet"><strong>Performance Hub</strong> - provides real-time view of performance data directly on the OCI ADB console.
            </p>
            <p class="nobullet">Performance Hub contains the following:</p>
            <ul class="cta-list" style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1em; margin-left:175px;">
                <li>- Time Range field and time slider</li>
                <li>- Active Session History (ASH) Analytics tab</li>
                <li>- SQL Monitor tab</li>
            </ul>
            &nbsp;
            <p class="nobullet">These features provides a simple one-click way to access the same information as found in EM Express, Oracle Management Cloud (OMC), and SQL Developer Web. The most likely target audience for this new feature will be cloud DBAs who manage a range of ADB instances within a single tenant and need a simple and fast way to monitor the performance of individual ADB instances directly from within the OCI Console. <a href="https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/listing/59419903">Click here for more information</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="nobullet"><strong>ADB Service Console</strong> - is a web-based service console for each database. Using this console, you can look at performance metrics like CPU storage utilization and monitor database activity. This console also provides real-time SQL monitoring for current and past SQL statements. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/manage-service.html#GUID-759EFFFA-9FAC-4439-B47F-281E470E01DE">Click here for more information</a>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Can I turn off Oracle Autonomous Database CPUs to save money?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes. You can do this by stopping the service from the cloud console or from the command line using the OCI APIs. This operation closes your ADB database, keeps your data in place, and stops charging for CPUs.
        </p>
        <h4>How long does it take to restart an instance after it has been stopped?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Starting an ADB instance is basically opening up your database. It is completed in seconds.</p>
        <h4>Can I create and set my own resource manager plan for workload management?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">No. ADB provides a simple resource manager plan out of the box.</p>
        <h4>Can I modify the resource profiles for existing consumer groups (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, etc.)?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes. Autonomous Database allows customers to change the CPU/IO shares for the consumer groups within their ADB instance (high, medium, low, tp, tpurgent).
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">This allows for use cases where, for example, a workload running in the LOW resource group requires a greater share of CPU/IO resources.
        </p>
        <h4>Can I modify the concurrency settings for any of the existing consumer groups (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, etc.)?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes. If your application requires a customized concurrency limit not available with the predefined services, you can modify the concurrency limit for the MEDIUM service from the Autonomous Database Service Console or using PL/SQL procedures. 
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">
        For example, when you run single-user benchmarks/POCs, you can set the concurrency limit of the MEDIUM service to 1 in order to obtain the highest DOP. For more information click here.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">
        More information is available <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/service--concurrency-limit-change.html#GUID-1E9CA2DC-241E-44A6-95AE-614F49D8872F" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Can I assign specific database users to specific database services (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, etc.) and prevent them from using other database services?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">No. Any user can connect to any database service of their choice - <em>providing they have a valid database username with the associated password</em>.
        </p>
        <h4>Can I use Oracle Management Cloud to monitor my autonomous database instances?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes. Licenses to use the Database Monitoring features of Oracle Management Cloud are in included in your subscription to Autonomous Data Warehouse and Autonomous Transaction Processing.
        </p>
        <div><a name="MIGRATION-BOOKMARK"></a></div>
        <h2>MIGRATION</h2>
        <h4>How can I migrate my existing Oracle Database to Oracle Autonomous Database?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Since an ADB database has some restrictions on the object types and Oracle Database Options you need to use a logical migration method rather than a physical one.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">The main migration tool for migrating to ADB is Data Pump. You can export your schemas and import them into ADB using Data Pump. To sync up the additional/incremental changes on the source database during the export/import process you can use GoldenGate or GoldenGate Cloud Service to replicate those changes to ADB.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">In the current release you cannot use physical migration methods like backup/restore, Data Guard, database clones, and transportable tablespaces to move your existing database to ADB.
        </p>
        <h4>Can I import an existing Oracle Database schema into Oracle Autonomous Database?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes. You can use Data Pump to export the source schema, move the dump files to the object store, and use Data Pump Import to load them into your ADB database.
        </p>
        <h4>Can I move my on-premises Oracle Database to Oracle Autonomous Database using RMAN backup and restore?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">No, RMAN restore into ADB is not supported. You need to use one of the supported migration methods outlined above.
        </p>
        <h4>Can I use original export import methods (exp/imp) to migrate to Oracle Autonomous Database?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">No, the original export/import methods are not supported in ADB. You need to use one of the supported migration methods outlined above or in the documentation.
        </p>
        <h4>How can I export my data from Oracle Autonomous Database?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">You can use Data Pump export utility to unload data from ADB. For smaller data sets you can also use any SQL client tool to spool your data to a text file.
        </p>
        <h4>Does Autonomous Database support XML?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes. Oracle XML DB features are now supported in Autonomous Database. To ensure the security and the performance of Autonomous Data Warehouse and Autonomous Transaction Processing, some Oracle XML DB features are restricted so refer to the documentation for a complete list of supported features.
        </p>
        <h4>Does Autonomous Database offer a pre-migration schema check tool?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes. Oracle Autonomous Database Schema Advisor is a light-weight utility that analyzes the on-premise or cloud Oracle Database schemas for the suitability of migration to the Autonomous Database. The Advisor discovers the schema objects and performs deep analysis to highlight is any differences exist when the object gets created on Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse or Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing database.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">The Advisor will run on pre-existing Schema and generates a report that highlights:</p>
        <ul class="cta-list" style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.8em; margin-left:55px; line-height: 1.55;">
            <li>- The counts of discovered objects and a summary of migration status.</li>
            <li>- Objects that cannot be migrated to the Autonomous Database due to the restrictions and lockdowns imposed by the Autonomous Database on certain data types, Database options and SQL statements/clauses.
            </li>
            <li>- The Objects that will migrate with modifications that are automatically done during the import process or upon the execution of object creation DDL.
            </li>
            <li>- Informational section containing certain best practice recommendations and guidance</li>

        <h2>PERFORMANCE</h2>
        <h4>Does Oracle Autonomous Database automatically create indexes when needed?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">If your ADB instance is using Database 19c then Automatic Indexing is available, however, it is not turned on by default.
        </p>
        <h4>Does Oracle Autonomous Database automatically create materialized views when needed?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">No, in the current release ADB does not create materialized views automatically.</p>
        <h4>Can I specify the amount of memory I want for my database?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">No, ADB configures the database memory (SGA and PGA) based on the number of CPUs you provision. Memory scales linearly with the number of CPUs.
        </p>
        <h4>What is the IO throughput in Oracle Autonomous Database?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">IO throughput depends on the number of CPUs you provision and scales linearly with the number of CPUs. Scaling the service is quick and easy in ADB, if you need more IO throughput you can add more CPUs online in a few seconds.
        </p>
        <h4>How does Oracle Autonomous Database isolate different customers for performance and how does it make sure a customer's workload does not impact others?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">ADB uses Database Resource Manager and IO Resource Manager to isolate resources for all databases. CPUs, memory, and IO resources are not over-provisioned in ADB, this makes sure every customer gets their assigned amount of resources at all times.
        </p>
        <h4>Does Oracle Autonomous Database open a database on multiple nodes or a single node? Does it depend on the number of CPUs?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">ADB may decide to open a database on a single node or multiple nodes. ADB does not expose these details because it is not necessary to know about this level of detail.
        </p>
        <h4>Where are the parallel processes running for a parallel query, on a single node or multiple nodes?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">ADB decides where to run a query and where to spawn the parallel processes, it may be on a single node or multiple nodes. Customers do not need to know about these implementation details since ADB controls this automatically.
        </p>
        <h4>It is possible to change the CPU/IO shares for the consumer groups?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes it is possible to change the CPU/IO shares for the consumer groups within their ADB instance (high, medium, low, tp, tpurgent). This allows for use cases where, for example, a workload running in the LOW resource group requires a greater share of CPU/IO resources than HIGH and MEDIUM.
        </p>
        <p class="nobullet">The 'Set Resource Management Rules' pop-up form on the administration section of the service console has been extended to allow the modification of CPU/IO shares across the different resource groups. It is also possible to change the resource shares within a script, application call and/or via a SQL prompt using the <span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:courier">cs_resource_manager package</span>.

        </p>
        <h4>Is it possible to control the predefined degree of parallelism (DOP) used by Autonomuos Database?</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Yes. In cases where selecting one of the default services does not meet your application’s performance needs, you can use the MEDIUM service and modify the concurrency limit. For example, when you run single-user benchmarks/POCs, you can set the concurrency limit of the MEDIUM service to 1 in order to obtain the highest DOP.
